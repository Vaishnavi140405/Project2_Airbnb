Airbnb Dynamic Pricing Recommendation Engine
This project builds a Dynamic Pricing Recommendation Engine for Airbnb listings using historical data. Python is used for data cleaning, feature engineering, and training a linear regression model to understand key price drivers. The processed data is then visualized in Power BI to analyze pricing trends and simulate dynamic price adjustments based on location, room type, seasonality, and listing quality. The system helps recommend optimal prices to improve revenue and occupancy.
